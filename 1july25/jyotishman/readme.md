##  Learnt About Deep Learning Theory (from video sessions)
### 1. What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze data and make decisions. It mimics the way humans learn certain types of information.

### 2. Why Use Deep Learning?
Deep learning is effective for tasks like image recognition, language translation, and speech recognition due to its ability to learn complex patterns.

### 3. What are Neural Networks?
Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes ("neurons") that process data. They include input, hidden, and output layers.

### 4. Applications of Deep Learning
- Image and speech recognition
- Self-driving cars
- Medical diagnosis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 5. What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is an open-source framework developed by Google to build and train deep learning models efficiently.

### 6. What is a Tensor?
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array (like a matrix) used to represent data in TensorFlow.
